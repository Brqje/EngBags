EngBags - 2019 Baroque edit

One-bag with item type auto-sort. I've modded it to use sensible categorization/auto sorting for both leveling and end-game TBC 2.4.3.

Modifications:

- Modified OpenAllBags hook to allow Blizzard "Open All Bags" keybind to actually toggle, instead of just open bags (similar to default UI behaviour)
- Updated categorization (updated search algorithms and added over 300 specific items)
